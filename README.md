# LeetCode Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in Python.

## Project Structure

The project is organized by problem category, with each category having its own directory.

-   `/Trees`: Solutions for tree-based problems.
-   ... (add more categories as you solve them)

## Running the Code

Each solution is a self-contained Python script. To run a specific solution:

1.  Navigate to the script's directory.
2.  Run the script directly from your IDE or using the Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python <script_name>.py
    ```
